# Guidelines — Ontology

!!! info "Planned"
    Guidelines ontologies are planned for future development. The enforcement actions ontologies are the current priority.

## Scope

Guidelines are non-binding guidance documents issued by regulatory authorities and ESAs. They typically:

- Interpret existing regulations
- Set expectations for compliance
- Provide best practices

## Planned jurisdictions

- Sweden (FI guidelines and memoranda)
- Norway (Finanstilsynet rundskriv)
- Denmark (DFSA vejledninger)
- Spain (CNMV/BdE circulares and guías)
- EU (EBA/ESMA/EIOPA guidelines)

## Relation to enforcement actions

Guidelines are often referenced in enforcement actions as the standard of compliance. The `REFERENCES` relation will link enforcement actions to the relevant guidelines.
