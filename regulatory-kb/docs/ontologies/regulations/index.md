# Regulations — Ontology

!!! info "Planned"
    Regulations ontologies are planned for future development.

## Scope

Regulations are binding legislative instruments at both national and EU level. At the national level, they include:

- Swedish FFFS (Finansinspektionens föreskrifter)
- Norwegian forskrifter
- Danish bekendtgørelser
- Spanish reales decretos and órdenes ministeriales

At the EU level, regulations (unlike directives) are directly applicable in member states without transposition.

## Relation to enforcement actions

Regulations are the direct target of `ENFORCES` relations from enforcement actions. They in turn have `IMPLEMENTS` relations to EU directives.
