# Access Rules

## Principles

- Least privilege by default.
- Separate admin and daily-use accounts where possible.
- Remove access within 24 hours of offboarding.

## Access Baseline

- GitHub org uses 2FA.
- Production access is limited to designated maintainers.
- Shared credentials are prohibited unless managed in approved secret tooling.

## Review Cadence

- Quarterly access review.
- Immediate review after incidents or role changes.
